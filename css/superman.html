    <h1>Superman</h1>
    <p>
      Superman is a superhero created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe
      Shuster, first appearing in the comic book Action Comics #1, published in
      America on April 18, 1938.<br />[1] Superman has been regularly published
      in American comic books since 1938, and has been adapted to other media
      including radio serials, novels, films, television shows, theater, and
      video games.<br />
      Superman is the archetypal superhero: he wears an outlandish costume, uses
      a codename, and fights evil with the aid of extraordinary abilities.<br />
      Although there are earlier characters who arguably fit this definition, it
      was Superman who popularized the superhero genre and established its
      conventions. He was the best-selling superhero in American comic books up
      until the 1980s
